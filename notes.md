to automatically watch and compile typescript to javscript: 
```tsc (typescriptFileName) (javascriptFileName) -w```

if typescript filename is same as javascript filename:
```tsc [typescriptFileName] -w```

The -w extension - which is optional - is in order for typescript to automatically compile to javascript upon file change so we don't have to do it manually. Ce nous est plus facile est idéal.
