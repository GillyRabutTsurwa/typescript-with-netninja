## Type Basics

- Typescript uses strict types Javascript does not.
- Typescript uses **inference** to implicitly define the data type of the variable. We will explicitly define variable's data types later on.
- If you want more info on strict types and strict mode there's a good read [here](https://medium.com/@cyrilletuzi/typescript-strictly-typed-strict-mode-is-not-enough-40df698e2deb)
- Strict types are also defined for for function parametres. The good practise is to define these explicitly, and not implicitly, nor with the any keyword. Thus, it is best to define a specific data type to the variable.
