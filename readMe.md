how to configure typescript for websites and applications. At least one way anyways.
it is a lot like my gulp workflow for websits.
Only difference is the "include" line in the tsconfig.json. It says, only compile and distributes the typescript file in the folder names defined in the array. (you can take a look at the last line in the tsconfig.json file)
while you're there. look at the file overall.
